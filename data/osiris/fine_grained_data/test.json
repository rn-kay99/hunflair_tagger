UDP-glucuronosyltransferases are a family of drug metabolizing enzymes contributing to hepatic drug metabolism and protection against environmental toxins. The aim of this study was to identify polymorphisms at the human UGT1A gene locus and to characterize their function and potential association with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Genomic DNA from the blood of 363 subjects (128 patients with HCC, 235 blood donors) was analyzed for polymorphisms of the  UGT1A3 ,  UGT1A4 ,  UGT1A8 ,  UGT1A9 ,  UGT1A1 ,  UGT1A10  genes using polymerase chain reaction, sequencing analysis. Recombinant variant UGT protein was analyzed by activity assays. In the  UGT1A8  gene an  A173G  variant and a conserved  G to A exchange at position 765  were detected in 25% and 15%.  UGT1A9  exhibited two variants  C3Y  and  M33T  in 1% and 3%.  UGT1A1 ,  UGT1A10  exhibited conserved nucleotide exchanges ( 128 G-->A  and  696 C-->T ) in 2% and 13%. In the  UGT1A3  gene a  W11R , a  V47A  variant, and a conserved  G to A exchange at position 81  with an incidence of 65%, 58%, and 65%, respectively, were identified.  UGT1A4  exhibited a  P24T  and an  L48V  variant in 8% and 9%. UGT1A SNPs were not associated with HCC.  UGT1A4   P24T  and  L48V  exhibited reduced glucuronidation activities: beta-naphthylamine 30% and 50%, and dihydrotestosterone 50% and 0%, respectively. In conclusion, the high prevalence of SNPs throughout the human UGT1A gene locus illustrates a genetic basis of interindividual variations of hepatic metabolism. Two polymorphisms of the hepatic  UGT1A4  protein show a differential metabolic activity toward mutagenic amines and endogenous steroids, altering hepatic metabolism and detoxification.",

BACKGROUND: Excessive proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and leukocytes within the artery wall is a major event in the development of atherosclerosis. The growth suppressor  p27kip1  associates with several cyclin-dependent kinase/cyclin complexes, thereby abrogating their capacity to induce progression through the cell cycle. Recent studies have implicated  p27kip1  in the control of neointimal hyperplasia. For instance,  p27kip1  ablation in apolipoprotein-E-null mice enhanced arterial cell proliferation and accelerated atherogenesis induced by dietary cholesterol. Therefore,  p27kip1  is a candidate gene to modify the risk of developing atherosclerosis and associated ischaemic events (i.e., myocardial infarction and stroke). RESULTS: In this study we found three common single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the human  p27kip1  gene ( +326T>G [V109G] ,  -79C>T , and  -838C>A ). The frequency of  -838A  carriers was significantly increased in myocardial infarction patients compared to healthy controls (odds ratio [OR] = 1.73, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] = 1.12-2.70). In addition, luciferase reporter constructs driven by the human  p27kip1  gene promoter containing  A at position -838  had decreased basal transcriptional activity when transiently transfected in Jurkat cells, compared with constructs bearing  C in -838  (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that  -838A  is associated with reduced  p27kip1  promoter activity and increased risk of myocardial infarction.",

Paragangliomas of the head and neck region are a group of rare, usually benign, slow-growing tumors developing from paraganglionic chemoreceptors in most patients. Mutations in a subunit of the  mitochondrial enzyme II complex (succinate dehydrogenase [SDHD])  were shown to be responsible for the formation of paragangliomas. In addition, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 11, mainly in 11q23 ( PGL1 ), was observed recently. We analyzed DNA derived from tumor sections of three unrelated paraganglioma patients (one case with multiple paragangliomas, two cases with single tumors; all of them sporadic cases) for mutations in the  SDHD  gene by direct sequencing. Microsatellite-based LOH was performed, and events of chromosomal loss were validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on paraffin-embedded tumor and normal tissue by using centromeric satellite DNA. Sequence analysis revealed mutations in  SDHD  exon 1 in all patients, affecting the initiation codon ( M1V ). Another alteration was detected in exon 2 but was lacking in tumor DNA and therefore classified as polymorphism ( H50R ). LOH and FISH analyses demonstrated partial/total monosomy for chromosome 11 in the tumor samples tested. A common genetic mechanism appears to be the pathophysiologic basis for sporadic tumor development because the proposed two-hit model comprising both LOH and point mutation is manifest in our patients. Loss of chromosome 11 regions, including the deletion of  PGL1  and  PGL2  loci, may result in a more severe phenotype, as exemplified by the development of multiple tumors in one of the patients.",

OBJECTIVE: In the era of postgenomic research, linkage- and association-based strategies are beginning to reveal novel complex disease genes. Using such an approach, a functional haplotype of the  peptidylarginine deiminase 4 gene  ( PADI4 ) has recently been identified as a gene conferring susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a Japanese population. In the present study, we investigated the association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the  PADI4  gene with RA in a UK population. METHODS: Association with 4 exonic SNPs ( padi4_89*G/A ,  padi4_90*T/C ,  padi4_92*G/C , and  padi4_104*T/C ), mapping to the  PADI4  gene and defining a haplotype previously reported to be associated with RA, was investigated. Genotyping was performed using 5' allelic discrimination assays. Estimated haplotypes were generated using the expectation-maximization algorithm, and frequencies of the SNPs and haplotypes were compared between unrelated Caucasian RA patients from the UK (n = 839) and population controls (n = 481). RESULTS: Allele frequencies for the 4 SNPs in the UK population were similar to those reported in the Japanese control population, but none of these was associated with RA. As in the Japanese population, the SNPs in the UK population defined 2 major haplotypes, but neither was associated with RA (P = 0.79). CONCLUSION: A  PADI4  susceptibility haplotype associated with RA in a Japanese population is not associated with RA in a UK population. Other genes involved in the citrullinating pathway remain strong candidate RA-susceptibility genes and require further investigation.",

Oxidative stress contributes to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.  p22phox-based NAD(P)H oxidases  exist in the vessel wall, acting as important superoxide-generating systems in the vasculature. Some studies have identified reduced atherosclerosis in the presence of the  C242T   CYBA  polymorphism, whereas others have not. Because vascular  p22phox  is identical to neutrophil  p22phox , we studied the association between the  C242T ,  A640G , and  -930A/G   CYBA  polymorphisms and the quantity of superoxide produced from neutrophils isolated from healthy adults to determine if these polymorphisms had any functional impact on  NADPH oxidase  function. Neutrophils were isolated from 90 subjects by Percoll density gradient centrifugation. Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction mapping, as well as real-time PCR. The oxidative burst was stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Superoxide was quantified using the  superoxide dismutase  inhibitable oxidation of the spin probe hydroxylamine 1-hydroxy-3-carboxy-pyrrolidine, detected by electron paramagnetic resonance. Superoxide production was significantly affected by the  C242T  polymorphism, being 8.7+/-0.7, 7.9+/-0.6, and 5.9+/-1.2 micromol/L per minute per 10(6) neutrophils for the  C242T  CC, CT, and TT genotypes, respectively (P<0.05). In contrast, the  A640G  and the  -930A/G  polymorphisms did not alter the neutrophil respiratory burst. Phagocytic respiratory burst activity in homozygous individuals with the T allele of the  C242T   CYBA  polymorphism is significantly lower than of wild-type carriers and heterozygous individuals. Because  p22phox  exists in both the neutrophil and vessel wall, vascular oxidative stress is likely diminished in individuals with this polymorphism.",

Distributions and frequencies of  GSTP1  genetic variants were not statistically different between AD patients and healthy controls. Higher frequencies of the mutant genotypes were observed in AD patients (13% for both  A313G  and  C341T ) when compared with control subjects (7% for  A313G  and 8% for  C341T ), but association of  GSTP1  GG (OR 2.057, 95% CI 0.796-5.315, p=0.094) and TT (OR 1.691, 95% CI 0.669-4.270, p=0.514) genotypes with an increased risk of AD was not confirmed by statistical analysis. The frequencies of  GSTP1  alleles (A, B, C, D) did not significantly differ between AD patients and controls and they were indicated as follows: 52.7%, 15.2%, 12.5% and 19.6% for AD cases and 58.4%, 14.1%, 14.1% and 13.4% for controls. The estimation of the  GSTP1  haplotype distribution showed that  GSTP1*A/GSTP1*B  and  GSTP1*A/GSTP1*C  haplotypes were less frequent, while  GSTP1*B/GSTP1*B  and  GSTP1*C/GSTP1*D  haplotypes were more frequent in AD patients than in controls. In conclusion, the involvement of  GSTP1  alleles in individual susceptibility to AD was not confirmed as statistically significant in the tested Croatian Caucasian population. A possible role of  GSTP1  in the complex etiopathogenesis of AD is further discussed, based on observed differences in haplotype distribution and higher frequencies of mutant genotypes in AD patients.",

INTRODUCTION: Receptor-mediated estrogen activation participates in the development and progression of breast cancer.  Estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha  polymorphism has been found to be associated with breast cancer and clinical features of the disease in Caucasians. Epidemiologic studies have revealed that age-incidence patterns of breast cancer in Asians differ from those in Caucasians. Genomic data for  ER-alpha  in either population is therefore of value in the clinical setting for that ethnic group. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted to establish a database of  ER-alpha  polymorphisms in a Taiwanese population in order to compare Western and Taiwanese (Asian) distributions and to evaluate  ER-alpha  polymorphism as an indicator of clinical outcome. The  ER-alpha  gene was scanned in a Taiwanese clinical breast cancer group (189 patients) and in healthy individuals (177 healthy control individuals). PCR single-strand conformation polymorphism technology was employed and real-time PCR melting curve analysis was performed. RESULTS: Three sites of silent single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) were found, as reported previously in Western studies, but at significantly different frequencies. Among the three SNPs, the frequency of allele 1  (TCT --> TCC) in codon 10  was significantly lower in breast cancer patients (32.0%) than in control individuals (40.4%; P = 0.018). We found that allele 1  (ACG --> ACA) in codon 594  was less common in breast cancer patients with a family history of breast cancer (5.9%) than in those without such a history (19.6%; P = 0.049). Individually, both allele 1 in  codon 325 (CCC --> CCG)  and allele 1 in  codon 594  exhibited a reverse association with the occurrence of lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, incorporation of both SNP markers further increased predictive accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that  ER-alpha  polymorphisms are correlated with various aspects of breast cancer in Taiwan.  ER-alpha  genotype, as determined during presurgical evaluation, might represent a surrogate marker for predicting breast cancer lymph node metastasis.",

BACKGROUND: In part, the long-term survival of kidney transplants depends on the efforts to perform grafts with good  human leukocyte antigen (HLA)  compatibility, but there are other mechanisms that must induce some sort of tolerance and impair the anti-graft immune reaction. Because cytokines are one of the main components of immune response, we evaluated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of several cytokine genes that may influence the production of a given cytokine and therefore the features of immune reactions. METHODS: A total of 416 first cadaveric kidney transplants were monitored for  HLA  matching. After 10 years, the graft was still functional in 171 of 416 patients; 102 of 171 patients were also typed for cytokine polymorphisms. RESULTS: The mismatch distributions in patients who underwent transplantation were not statistically different from the entire group of patients who underwent transplantation during the same time period. Moreover, it seems that almost all of the  HLA  class I incompatible long-term survivors are homozygous for  GG at the -1082   interleukin (IL)-10  or  CC at the -33IL4 . CONCLUSIONS: We observed that a match for class I and class II  HLA  antigens apparently does not favor the long-term survival of transplanted kidneys. In fact, matched grafts are lost before 10 years in the same proportion as the mismatched grafts. We also demonstrated (1) that patients who are homozygous for GG at the SNP  -1082IL10  (high  IL-10  producers) and  HLA  class I mismatched (but matched for class II) are protected from chronic rejection, and (2) that patients who are homozygous for CC at the SNP  -33IL4  (low  IL-4  producers) and  HLA  class I mismatched (regardless of matching for class II) are protected from chronic rejection.",

Inflammation has been implicated as an etiological factor in several human cancers. Growing evidence suggests that chronic inflammation may also play a role in the etiology of prostate cancer. Considering that genetic susceptibility is a major risk factor for this disease, we hypothesize that sequence variants in genes that regulate inflammation may modify individual susceptibility to prostate cancer. The lipopolysaccharide receptor  Toll-like receptor 4  ( TLR4 ) is a central player in the signaling pathways of the innate immune response to infection by Gram-negative bacteria and is an important candidate inflammatory gene. We performed a systematic genetic analysis of  TLR4  sequence variants by evaluating eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms that span the entire gene among 1383 newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients and 780 age- and residence-matched controls in Sweden. We found an association between a sequence variant ( 11381G/C ) in the 3'-untranslated region of the  TLR4  gene and prostate cancer risk. The frequency of the variant genotypes (CG or CC) was significantly higher in the patients (24.1%) than in the controls (19.7%; P = 0.02). The frequency of risk genotypes among patients diagnosed before the age of 65 years was even higher (26.3%). Compared with men who had the wild-type genotype of this single-nucleotide polymorphism (GG), those with GC or CC genotypes had a 26% increased risk for prostate cancer (odds ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.57) and 39% increased risk increased risk for early onset prostate cancer (before age 65 years; odds ratio, 1.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.91). The risk attributable to this variant for prostate cancer in Sweden was estimated to be 4.9%. Although the biological mechanism of the observed association remains to be elucidated, our finding supports a role for a bacteria-associated response pathway, possibly acting via inflammation, in the development of prostate cancer.",

Although these four SNPs analysed lie within a less than 4 kb segment of genomic DNA, the pattern of linkage disequilibrium between them was unexpected. The strongest linkage disequilibrium was shown only between  rs367398  and  rs520692  and between  rs520692  and  rs422951  in both parent and patient groups. This study raises the possibility that there might be two or more disease-underlying variants at the  NOTCH4  locus or at a nearby locus, and that the allelic or locus heterogeneity may be one of the possible reasons for the poor replication of the  NOTCH4  finding.",

BACKGROUND/AIMS: The pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to examine genetic influences on NASH pathogenesis. METHODS: Blood samples from 63 patients with biopsy-proven NASH and 150 healthy controls were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Two functional polymorphisms were studied: the  -493 G/T  polymorphism in the promoter of  microsomal triglyceride transfer protein  (MTP) and the  1183 T/C  polymorphism in the mitochondrial targeting sequence of  manganese superoxide dismutase  ( MnSOD ). RESULTS: NASH patients had a much higher incidence of the MTP gene G allele (P=0.001) and of the G/G genotype (P=0.002) compared to the controls. Fat occupied more area in liver lobules and the stage of NASH was advanced in patients with the G/G-genotype than in patients with G/T-genotype (P=0.04). NASH patients also had a higher incidence of the  MnSOD  T/T genotype (P=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: The G allele in the MTP promoter leads to decreased MTP transcription, less export of triglyceride from hepatocytes, and greater intracellular triglyceride accumulation. The T allele in  MnSOD  mitochondrial targeting sequence leads to less transport of  MnSOD  to the mitochondria. Therefore, functional polymorphisms in MTP and  MnSOD  may be involved in determining susceptibility of NASH.",

BACKGROUND: Venous thrombosis is a multicausal disease involving both genetic as well as acquired risk factors. Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with a 2-fold increased risk of recurrent venous thrombosis (RVT). Recently, the  894 G > T  variant of  endothelial nitric oxide synthase  ( eNOS ) was postulated to be associated with hyperhomocysteinemia. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized an interrelation of hyperhomocysteinemia, the  eNOS   894 G > T  variant and RVT risk. METHODS: The  eNOS   894 G > T  variant was studied in 170 cases with a history of RVT and 433 controls from the general population. RESULTS: The  eNOS   894 TT  genotype may increase RVT risk [odds ratio (OR) 1.3 (0.7-2.6)], but no association of the  eNOS   894 G > T  variant with elevated homocysteine was found in controls. Interestingly, in RVT cases the coexistence of both the  894 TT  genotype and elevated tHcy levels (> 90th percentile) was more frequently present than in controls, which led to a substantially increased risk of recurrent venous thrombosis [fasting tHcy OR 5.3 (1.1-24.1), postload tHcy OR 6.5 (1.6-29.5)]. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study demonstrate that the  eNOS   894 G > T  variation interacts with elevated tHcy levels, leading to an increased risk of recurrent thrombotic events. This interaction points in the direction of S-nitrosation as a mechanism by which homocysteine exerts its detrimental effects on the hemostatic system.",

Hepatic lipase (HL)  is a glycoprotein that plays a major role in remodeling high-density lipoprotein (HDL). The effect of the  -250G/A  promoter polymorphism on coronary artery disease (CAD) and lipid levels was studied in 231 male CAD patients and in a population-based sample of men and women (n = 514). A sample of 140 men was chosen among those included in the population-based sample as controls for the CAD sample. In the total group of CAD patients, the frequency of the  -250A  allele was somewhat lower (25% in CAD patients and 32% in controls; p = 0.06), but when the control samples were compared only with the CAD(+) sample (more than 60% of luminal stenosis in at least one coronary artery or major branch segment) the  -250A  allele was significantly less frequent (23% in the patients vs 32% in controls; p = 0.02). A multiple logistic regression analysis showed that this association was independent of classical CAD risk factors [odds ratio (OR) = 1.79, p = 0.025]. Using multiple linear regression analyses, it has been shown that this polymorphism was a significant factor affecting HDL-C levels in men from the population-based sample (p = 0.001), an interaction between  -250G/A  variant and wine consumption was also detected (p = 0.001). Thus, our results show that the  -250G/A  polymorphism in the HL gene is associated with significant variations in HDL-C levels and CAD risk in males.",

OBJECTIVE: Recently, there has been considerable interest in the association of specific cancers with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In this regard, genetic polymorphism at  codon 72 (CCC/proline to CGC/arginine [Pro(72)Arg])  of the  p53  gene is one of the most frequently studied subjects. An association between endometrial cancer and the polymorphism at  codon 31 (AGC/serine to AGA/arginine [Ser(31)Arg])  of the  p21  gene, which is known to be a downstream mediator of  p53 , has also been reported. METHODS: The authors designed a hospital-based case-control study of 95 endometrial cancer patients and 285 non-cancer controls. For the determination of  p53  and  p21  polymorphism, allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay was applied, respectively. RESULTS: We found statistically significant differences in the frequency of the  p53  and  p21  genotypes between these two groups (P < 0.001), respectively. The  p53  genotypes containing the Pro allele were significantly associated with endometrial cancer with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.56 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.10-6.04). Also, homozygous carriers of the  p21  Ser allele showed a substantially increased risk of developing endometrial cancer (OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.59-4.51) as compared to homozygous and heterozygous carriers of the Arg allele. In addition, the combination of the pro allele containing genotypes of  p53  and the Ser homozygous genotype of  p21  posed a remarkably increased risk (OR 9.55, 95% CI 4.30-21.24) of endometrial cancer development. These significant differences were maintained throughout the groups after they were stratified by menopausal status. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that there is a significant association between the genetic polymorphisms of  p53 ,  p21 , and specific combinations of the at-risk genotypes of these genes and the risk of developing endometrial cancer in Korean women.",

The  ATM [for ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) mutated]  protein plays a key role in the detection and cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been described in the  ATM  gene; however, their association with cancer risk or radiosensitivity remains to be fully established. In this study, the functional consequences of specific  ATM  SNPs on in vitro radiosensitivity, as assessed by micronuclei (MN) formation, were measured in lymphoblastoid cell lines established from 10 breast cancer (BC) patients carrying different  ATM  missense SNPs, six A-T patients, six A-T heterozygotes (A-T het), and six normal individuals. The BC, A-T het, and A-T cell line groups showed significantly higher mean levels of MN formation after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) than did the group containing normal cell lines, with similar levels in the BC and A-T het groups. Within the BC lines studied, the group composed of the six carrying the linked  2572T>C (858F>L)  and  3161C>G (1054P>R)  variants had a higher level of MN after IR exposure compared to that observed in the remaining four BC or in the normal cell lines. This increase was not related to the constitutive  ATM  mRNA level, which was similar in these BC and the normal cell lines. Our results indicate that alterations in the  ATM  gene, including the presence of heterozygous mutations and the 2572C and 3161G variant alleles, are associated with increased in vitro chromosomal radiosensitivity, perhaps by interfering with  ATM  function in a dominant-negative manner.",

Hereditary predisposition and causative environmental exposures have long been recognized in human malignancies. In most instances, cancer cases occur sporadically, suggesting that environmental influences are critical in determining cancer risk. To test the influence of genetic polymorphisms on breast cancer risk, we have measured 98 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed over 45 genes of potential relevance to breast cancer etiology in 174 patients and have compared these with matched normal controls. Using machine learning techniques such as support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, and naive Bayes, we identified a subset of three SNPs as key discriminators between breast cancer and controls. The SVMs performed maximally among predictive models, achieving 69% predictive power in distinguishing between the two groups, compared with a 50% baseline predictive power obtained from the data after repeated random permutation of class labels (individuals with cancer or controls). However, the simpler naive Bayes model as well as the decision tree model performed quite similarly to the SVM. The three SNP sites most useful in this model were (a) the  +4536T/C  site of the aldosterone synthase gene  CYP11B2  at amino acid residue  386 Val/Ala (T/C) (rs4541) ; (b) the  +4328C/G  site of the aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase  CYP1B1  at amino acid residue  293 Leu/Val (C/G) (rs5292) ; and (c) the  +4449C/T  site of the transcription factor  BCL6  at amino acid  387 Asp/Asp (rs1056932) . No single SNP site on its own could achieve more than 60% in predictive accuracy. We have shown that multiple SNP sites from different genes over distant parts of the genome are better at identifying breast cancer patients than any one SNP alone. As high-throughput technology for SNPs improves and as more SNPs are identified, it is likely that much higher predictive accuracy will be achieved and a useful clinical tool developed.",

Nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCLP) is one of the most common craniofacial malformations. Both genetic and environmental factors are involved in the pathogenesis. In addition to its role as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesized by glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) is presumed to play a role in normal embryonic, especially facial, development. This notion has been substantiated by the fact that Gad67 knockout mice have been shown to have cleft palate. We hypothesized that  GAD67  may be involved in the development of NSCLP and investigated the possible association between the  GAD67  gene ( GAD67 ) and NSCLP in Japanese patients. We screened 50 probands for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in  GAD67  using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and found seven SNPs. Since two SNPs showed complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) to the other SNPs, we constructed a 5-locus haplotype of  GAD67 . The frequency distribution of the haplotype differed between NSCLP patients and controls (P = 0.0028). The frequency of  -445A ,  -292A ,  -147G ,  111C , and  IVS9-39T  haplotype in the NSCLP patients was significantly lower than that in controls (P = 0.00098).

Gas6-deficient mice are protected against thrombosis, demonstrating the importance of this protein in the cardiovascular system. The present study was aimed at determining the human  GAS6  intron-exon structure and analyzing the gene for the presence of allelic variants that could be associated with atherothrombotic disease. Online analyses allowed us to localize 15  GAS6  exons and to determine the sequence of their intron-flanking regions, in a chromosome 13 region spanning 43.8 kb of DNA. SSCP analysis of PCR-amplified  GAS6  exons with their intron-flanking regions from a minimum of 12 control DNA samples, revealed the presence of eight different variants, which were confirmed to be single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Three of them ( c.1263G>C ,  c.1332C>T , and  c.1869T>C ) are localized in exons 11, 12, and 14, and appear to be neutral since they do not modify the encoded amino acid.

Phenotypic expression of the deafness-associated homoplasmic  A1555G  mutation in the  mitochondrial 12S rRNA  gene varies from profound congenital hearing loss to normal hearing. It has been shown that this variability in clinical expression in most patients is due to the complex inheritance of multiple nuclear-encoded modifier genes.  Human mitochondrial transcription factor B1  ( TFB1M ) has been proposed as a candidate for being such a modifier, since it methylates adenine residues in the adjacent loop of the  A1555G  mutation in the 12S rRNA gene. Polymorphic markers within and adjacent to the  TFB1M  gene were genotyped in 214 individuals from 41 multiplex families with the  A1555G  mutation of Spanish, Italian, and Arab-Israeli origin. Multipoint non-parametric linkage analysis of all families combined revealed an NPL score of 1.7 (P = 0.05), and a Lod score of 1.4 (P = 0.04). Linkage disequilibrium by the Transmission Disequilibrium Test at  D6S1577 , a microsatellite adjacent to  TFB1M , showed preferential non-transmission of an allele to affected individuals with chi2 = 8.76; P = 0.003. Sequence analysis of the coding region of the gene and testing of all intragenic SNPs did not reveal a putative causative mutation. These data provide suggestive evidence that  TFB1M  is a nuclear-encoded modifier gene for phenotypic expression of the  A1555G  mutation, and that the effect may occur through a regulatory or splicing mutation.",

To examine the effect of natural selection on the pattern of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and to infer the evolutionary history of the  HbE  variant, we analyzed biallelic markers surrounding the  HbE  variant in a Thai population. Pairwise LD analysis of  HbE  and 43 surrounding biallelic markers revealed LD of  HbE  extending beyond 100 kb, whereas no LD was observed between non- HbE  variants and the same markers. The inferred haplotype network suggests a single origin of the  HbE  variant in the Thai population. Forward-in-time computer simulations under a variety of selection models indicate that the  HbE  variant arose 1,240-4,440 years ago. These results support the conjecture that the  HbE  mutation occurred recently, and the allele frequency has increased rapidly. Our study provides another clear demonstration that a high-resolution LD map across the human genome can detect recent variants that have been subjected to positive selection.",

It then became germane to determine the prevalence of the  46C-->T  polymorphism and its relative risk of thrombotic disease. We followed up evidence for genetic linkage with a case-control study, including 250 unrelated consecutive Spanish patients suffering from venous thrombotic disease and 250 Spanish subjects matched for sex and age as a controls. We measured  FXII  levels and genotyped the  46C-->T  polymorphism, as well as a number of classical risk factors for thrombotic disease.We confirmed that individuals with different genotypes for this polymorphism showed significant differences in their  FXII  levels. Most importantly, the mutated T allele in the homozygous state (genotype T/T) was associated with an increased risk of thrombosis (adjusted OR of 4.82; 95% CI 1.5-15.6), suggesting that the polymorphism itself is an independent risk factor for venous thromboembolism. This study confirms that the  46C-->T  polymorphism is a genetic risk factor for venous thrombosis in the Spanish population.

After adjustment for confounding factors,  adiponectin  concentration was significantly lower in HT (HT: 5.2+/-0.2 microg/mL; NT: 6.1+/-0.2 microg/mL; P<0.001). Furthermore, multiple regression analysis indicated that hypoadiponectinemia was an independent risk factor for hypertension (P<0.001).

The hepatic mRNA expression of the  sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1)  in CBA/JN was remarkably enhanced by high fructose diet but not in DBA/2N. Similar results were observed in primary hepatocytes after exposure to fructose.

In hepatocytes from CBA/JN, the activity of CBA- SREBP-1c  promoter was significantly increased by 2.4- and 2.2-fold, in response to 30 mm fructose or 10 nm insulin, respectively, whereas the activity of DBA- SREBP-1c  promoter responded to insulin but not to fructose. In hepatocytes from DBA/2N, both types of  SREBP-1c  promoter activities in response to  insulin  were attenuated. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed an unidentified nuclear protein bound to the oligonucleotides made from the region between -453 to -480 bp of the  SREBP-1c  promoter of CBA/JN but not to the probe from DBA/2N. Thus, in DBA/2N, the reduced mRNA expression of SREBP-1 after fructose refeeding appeared to associate with two independent mechanisms, 1). loss of binding of unidentified proteins to the region between -453 to -480 bp of the  SREBP-1c  promoter and 2). impaired  insulin  stimulation of  SREBP-1c  promoter activity.",

Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped for the 274 such families and within-family transmission disequilibrium tests were performed. SNP  rs4680 , which is the functional Val/Met polymorphism, showed modest association with the disease by the TRANSMIT, FBAT and PDT programs, while the other two SNPs were negative. These SNPs showed lower level of LDs with each other in the Irish subjects than in Ashkenazi Jews. Haplotype analysis indicated that a haplotype, haplotype A-G-A for SNPs  rs737865 - rs4680 - rs165599 , was preferentially transmitted to the affected subjects.

We present data from a study of 1795 recent postmenopausal women, assigned to either hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or no treatment and followed for 5 years. The association between bone mass measurements and two single nucleotide polymorphisms, a  T (A1) to C (A2) transition in the 5'-UTR of the cytochrome P450c17alpha (CYP17)  gene and a  G (Val) to A (Met) transition in exon 4 of the catechol- O-methyltransferase (COMT)  gene, was evaluated. Association with  CYP17  genotype was modified by body mass index (BMI). In lean women, individuals homozygous for the  CYP17  A2 allele were 1 cm shorter and had lower baseline BMD (bone mineral density), BMC, and CSA (cross sectional area) in the spine and femoral neck than did other women (BMD spine A2A2: 0.975 g/cm2 versus 1.011 g/cm2 in A1A1 + A1A2, P = 0.002). Conversely, an adverse association with A2A2 and bone loss over 5 years seemed present only in overweight women, but differences were small. Response to HRT was not dependent on  CYP17  genotype.  COMT  genotype was not associated with bone mass at baseline, bone loss in untreated women, or response to HRT. In conclusion, the A2 allele of the  CYP17   T(27)-C  polymorphism is associated with reduced bone mass and bone size in lean perimenopausal women, whereas high BMI protects against this negative association.

Several lines of evidence implicate the  Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Antigen 4  ( CTLA4 ) gene in susceptibility to autoimmune disease. We have examined the association of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with polymorhisms within the  CTLA4  gene that were previously proposed to regulate  CTLA-4  function: a  single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in position +49 of exon 1  and a dinucleotide repeat in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). The 3'UTR repeat showed a significant association with SLE, with one allele conferring susceptibility and another conferring protection to the disease. The associated alleles do not support previous suggestions of an allele size-dependent effect of the 3' UTR polymorphism in autoimmunity development and instead suggest that it is in linkage disequilibrium with a true causative locus. No association of the exon 1 SNP with SLE was found in our population. Given the conflicting results obtained in different studies on the association of SLE with this polymorphism, we performed a meta-analysis including seven previously published studies and the present one. Significantly increased and decreased risks for SLE were found for carriers of the G allele and the A allele, respectively. The functional characterization of disease-associated  CTLA4  gene variants is now required to elucidate their role in the pathogenesis of SLE and other autoimmune diseases.",

Eight different single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in six different genes were investigated for possible association with breast cancer.

Two SNPs showed an association with breast cancer:  R72P  in TP53  and  P187S  in  NQO1 . Six SNPs,  Q356R  and  P871L  in  BRCA1 ,  N372H  in  BRCA2 ,  C112R (E4)  and  R158C (E2)  in  ApoE  and  C825T  in  GNB3 , did not show any sign of association. The  P187S  polymorphism in  NQO1  was associated with breast cancer in both populations from Tyrol and Prague with a higher risk for carriers of the  187S  allele. Combining the results of the two populations, we observed a highly significant difference (P=0.0004) of genotype and allele frequencies (odds ratio (OR)=1.46; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-1.85; P=0.001) and of the homozygote ratio (OR=3.8; 95% CI 1.73-8.34; P=0.0001). Combining the two 'candidate' SNPs ( P187S  and  R72P ) revealed an increased risk for breast cancer of double heterozygotes ( P187S / R72P ) of the  NQO1  and  TP53  genes (OR=1.88; 95% CI 1.13-3.15; P=0.011), suggesting a possible interaction of these two loci.",

Variation in the penetrance estimates for  BRCA1  and  BRCA2  mutation carriers suggests that other genetic polymorphisms may modify the cancer risk in carriers. The  RAD51  gene, which participates in homologous recombination double-strand breaks (DSB) repair in the same pathway as the  BRCA1  and  BRCA2  gene products, is a candidate for such an effect. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),  RAD51-135g-->c , in the 5' untranslated region of the gene has been found to elevate breast cancer (BC) risk among  BRCA2  carriers. We genotyped 309  BRCA1 /2 mutation carriers, of which 280 were of Ashkenazi origin, 166 noncarrier BC patients and 152 women unaffected with BC (a control group), for the  RAD51-135g-->c  SNP. Risk analyses were conducted using COX proportional hazard models for the  BRCA1 /2 carriers and simple logistic regression analysis for the noncarrier case-control population.  BRCA2  carriers were also studied using logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. The estimated BC hazard ratio (HR) for  RAD51-135c  carriers adjusted for origin (Ashkenazi vs non-Ashkenazi) was 1.28 (95% CI 0.85-1.90, P=0.23) for  BRCA1 /2 carriers, and 2.09 (95% CI 1.04-4.18, P=0.04) when the analysis was restricted to  BRCA2  carriers. The median BC age was younger in  BRCA2 - RAD51-135c  carriers (45 (95% CI 36-54) vs 52 years (95% CI 48-56), P=0.05). In a logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio (OR) was 5.49 (95% CI 0.5-58.8, P=0.163). In noncarrier BC cases, carrying  RAD51-135c  was not associated with BC risk (0.97; 95% CI 0.47-2.00). These results indicate significantly elevated risk for BC in carriers of  BRCA2  mutations who also carry a  RAD51-135c  allele.

BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms for cytokines and their receptors have been proposed as potential markers for periodontal disease.  Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2  ( TNFR2 ) is one of the cell surface receptors for  TNF-alpha . Recent studies have suggested that  TNFR2  gene polymorphism is involved in autoimmune and other diseases. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether  TNFR2 ( +587T/G ) gene polymorphism is associated with chronic periodontitis (CP). METHODS: One hundred and ninety-six unrelated subjects (age 40-65 years) with different levels of CP were identified according to established criteria, including measurements of probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and alveolar bone loss (BL). All subjects were of Japanese descent and non-smokers. Single nucleotide polymorphism at position  +587(T/G)  in the  TNFR2  gene was detected by a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP) method. RESULTS: The frequency and the positivity of the  +587G  allele were significantly higher in severe CP patients than in controls (p=0.0097; odds ratio=2.61, p=0.0075; odds ratio=3.06). In addition, mean values of PPD, CAL, and BL were significantly higher in the  +587G  allele positive than in the negative subjects (p=0.035, 0.022, and 0.018, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the  TNFR2 ( +587G ) polymorphic allele could be associated with severe CP in Japanese.",

BACKGROUND:  Uncoupling protein-2  ( UCP2 ), a recently identified member of the mitochondrial transporter superfamily, is a candidate gene for obesity. A common G/A polymorphism in the  UCP2  promoter region is associated with enhanced adipose tissue mRNA expression in vivo. METHODS: We developed a rapid and simple method, mutagenically separated polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) for genotyping  UCP2   - 866G/A  polymorphism. Two reverse mutagenic allele-specific primers of different lengths for the  UCP2   - 866G/A  polymorphic site were paired with the same forward primer in the same PCR reaction. RESULTS: Agarose gel electrophoresis (3.5%) showed at least one of the two allelic products and provided a within-assay quality control to exclude false-negative results. The 203-bp fragment of the PCR products was A allele-specific and the 183-bp fragment was G allele-specific. The frequencies of the  UCP2   - 866G/A  genotypes in 72 Japanese subjects were AA: 21 (29.2%), AG: 32 (44.4%), and GG: 19 (26.4%). The results were confirmed by the PCR-RFLP genotyping method, in which a 360-bp fragment of PCR products was cut into 290- and 70-bp fragments by the restriction enzyme MluI when the G allele was present. This Japanese group showed a higher frequency of the AA genotype, which is associated with a low prevalence of obesity, than Caucasian populations. CONCLUSIONS: The MS-PCR technique is a simple, rapid, and reliable method for genotyping  UCP2   - 866G/A  polymorphism.",

Insulin  resistance, which is pathogenic for type 2 diabetes (T2D), is under the control of largely unknown genetic determinants.  LAR , a protein-tyrosine phosphatase which inhibits  insulin  signalling, is overexpressed in animal and human models of  insulin  resistance. We studied the entire sequence of the  LAR  gene by SSCP analysis and automatic DNA sequencing, with the aim of verifying whether its sequence variants might be associated with  insulin  resistance. In the 276 bp sequence upstream of the transcriptional start site (i.e. a region we have identified as having basal promoter activity) a  -127 bp T-->A  SNP (5% frequency) was associated with lower body mass index (BMI) ( P=0.03), waist circumference ( P=0.01), blood pressure ( P=0.01) and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio ( P=0.04) in 589 non-diabetic unrelated individuals from the Gargano region (central east coast of Italy). To quantify the risk for a high body weight conferred by the  -127 T-->A  SNP, the whole cohort was divided into tertiles according to the individual BMI. The risk of belonging to the heavier tertile, as compared to the leaner one, was reduced by approximately 60%. In a population from East Sicily ( n=307), T/A genotype carriers ( n=13) showed lower triglyceride levels ( P=0.04) and higher  insulin  sensitivity as indicated by lower plasma glucose ( P=0.03) and serum  insulin  ( P=0.006) during oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT). Promoter activity, studied by cDNA transfection experiments, was similar for the A and T alleles. In conclusion, a genetic variant of the  LAR  gene promoter is consistently associated with features of  insulin  resistance in two different Caucasian populations. Although the biological relevance of this variant has yet to be determined, this finding underlines the potential importance of the  LAR  gene in dysregulation of  insulin  sensitivity and related disorders.",

BACKGROUND: Mutations in the  cardiac sodium channel gene  ( SCN5A ) may lead to a broad spectrum of familial arrhythmias, including long QT syndrome (LQTS), idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF), and isolated cardiac conduction diseases. Recent studies have shown that polymorphisms in the  SCN5A  gene also play an important role in the manifestation of disorders involving cardiac excitability. In this study, we investigated the polymorphisms of the  SCN5A  gene in Han Chinese and its relation to Brugada syndrome (BS). METHODS: Genomic DNA was isolated from 120 unrelated healthy volunteers and 48 unrelated Brugada syndrome patients by means of standard procedures. All exons including the putative splicing sites of the  SCN5A  gene were amplified by PCR and sequenced directly or after subcloning using an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer. RESULTS: A total of 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the Han Chinese population, including 3 novel ones:  G87A   (A29A) ,  4245 + 82A > G , and  G6174A . The allele frequencies of each SNP in the Han Chinese population were as follows:  G87A   (A29A)  27.5%,  A1673G    (H558R)  10.4%,  4245 + 82A > G  32.8%,  C5457T    (D1819D)  41.3%, and  G6174A  44.9%.  S1102Y  and 10 other SNPs identified in other ethnic populations were not detected in this study. There was no significant difference in the allele frequency of  A1673G    (H558R)   between different ethnic populations (all P > 0.5). On the other hand, the allele frequency of  C5457T  (D1819D)   among Han Chinese was similar to its frequency among Japanese (P > 0.5), but higher than that among Americans (P < 0.005). The allele  G1673   (R558)  was over-represented in BS patients compared to controls (P < 0.005), but there was no significant difference in genotype frequencies at this locus. There were also no differences in either the allele or genotype frequencies of the 4 other identified SNPs when comparing BS patients with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of  SCN5A  SNPs may vary between different ethnicities. The polymorphism of  A1673G  might be associated with BS and may contribute to a susceptibility to BS in Han Chinese.",

A positional cloning effort in French Canadian families with Paget's disease of bone (PDB) resulted in the identification of a mutation in the  sequestosome1  ( SQSTM1 ) gene in a subset of both familial and sporadic PDB cases. This was confirmed in samples of mainly United Kingdom (UK) origin. In this study, we performed both mutation analysis and association studies in order to evaluate the role of this gene in a collection of isolated Belgian PDB patients. A mutation in the  SQSTM1  gene was found in only 6 of 111 patients (5.4%). In all cases it involves the  P392L  mutation, previously shown to be common in both familial and sporadic cases. To perform association studies, we selected 8 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and looked for linkage disequilibrium (LD) between these. Haplotype analysis indicated that typing of 3 Tag SNPs ( IVS1 + 633A/C ,  IVS5 - 23A/G , and  976A/G ) enables us to identify the most common haplotypes. Association studies for the 3 selected SNPs, based on 105 PDB cases without a  SQSTM1  mutation and 159 control individuals, did not support a possible influence of natural variants in the  SQSTM1  gene either on the pathogenesis of PDB or on the disease severity. In conclusion, our study confirms that the  P392L  mutation is a recurrent mutation causing PDB in different populations. We were not able to show an association between  SQSTM1  polymorphisms and PDB in our population but this clearly needs to be extended to other populations. The presented identification of haplotype Tag SNPs will be of major help for such studies.",

Among 106 subjects with severe early onset obesity and a history of hyperphagia, we found two missense variants in  MCHR1 :  Y181H  and  R248Q . Neither of these was found in 192 normal weight controls.  R248Q  cosegregated with obesity across two generations; family data were unavailable for  Y181H . When expressed in HEK293 cells,  R248Q  showed no evidence of constitutive activation or ligand hypersensitivity for extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. In addition,  R248Q  showed no enhanced suppression of cAMP generation. Two common single-nucleotide polymorphisms were found to be in linkage disequilibrium:  g.-114A>G  and  c.39C>T . No association between either of these single-nucleotide polymorphisms and obesity-related phenotypes was found among a population cohort of 541 whites. Only two rare noncoding variants were found in  MCHR2 . In conclusion, mutations in the MCH receptors are not commonly found in humans with severe early onset obesity.

METHODS: In a case-control study, genotypes of 130 patients with JIA (63 male, 67 female; age at onset 7.6 +/- 4.4 yrs; 43 oligoarticular, 72 polyarticular, 15 systemic form) were compared to 102 healthy unrelated blood donors. Using the polymerase chain reaction technique with sequence-specific primers from the 13th IHWG workshop, we analyzed 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms within 12 different cytokine genes [ interleukin (IL)-1a ,  IL-1beta ,  IL-2 ,  IL-4 ,  IL-6 ,  IL-10 ,  IL-12 ,  transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta ,  interferon (IFN)-g ], and related molecules ( IL-1R ,  IL-1RA ,  IL-4Ra ). Genotype frequencies were compared using chi-square analysis, and the significance level was corrected for the number of independent tests. RESULTS: Significant positive association was found for the G allele of the  IL-4   -1098 T/G  polymorphism, which was carried by 10% of cases and 25% of controls [odds ratio (OR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16-0.67, corrected p = 0.038). Also, a nonsignificant increase in the frequency of the  IL-1beta   +3962 C  allele was detected in cases (96%) versus controls (84%) (OR 4.65, 95% CI 1.64-13.2, corrected p = 0.091). We did not replicate previously found associations with the  IL-1a ,  IL-6 ,  IL-10 , and  IL-1R IL-1RA  polymorphisms. CONCLUSION: Our study showed association with JIA for the  IL-4   -1098 T/G  polymorphism. It also underlines the genetic contribution of IL-1 polymorphisms to the pathogenesis of JIA, as another polymorphism within the  IL-1beta  may influence the risk of the disease.",
